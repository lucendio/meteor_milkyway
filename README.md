### What is this thing?

The ides is pretty straight forward: establishing a DDP-Connection directly between two
clients to get all benefits form DDP when exchanging data. Some crazy mesh-architecture 
might be interesting es well.



### Quick start

```javascript
// TODO
```



### Good to know

+   there is nothing here yet



### Checklist

- [ ]   change all DDP server code that it will run on the client
- [ ]   use [rtc](https://github.com/lucendio/meteor_rtc) to replace the transport layer 
        (websockets/sockjs
- [ ]   implementing some sort of security/auth layer (probably should be done by 
        [rtc](https://github.com/lucendio/meteor_rtc))
